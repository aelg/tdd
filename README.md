TDD Case
===

Mob programming case with TDD.

Instructions
---

1. Get 4-10 people.
2. Get a computer with a projector.
3. Start an IDE (Jetbrains Clion works well).
4. Run the testcase, it will fail.
5. Put one person at the keyboard.
6. Green phase, do the simplest possible change that fixes the test case.
7. Switch the person at the computer.
8. Refactoring phase, refactor the code. Make no changes to its behaviour.
9. Switch the person at the computer.
10. Red phase, write the simplest possible test case that won't work.
11. Switch the person at the computer.
12. Goto #6

Remember to run the test suite very often.
The person at the keyboard writes the code but is free to discuss with everyone else.
This is great for trying out mob programming and/or TDD and/or evaluating how well you can work together.
